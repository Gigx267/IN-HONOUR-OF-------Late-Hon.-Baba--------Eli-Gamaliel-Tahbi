When darkness veils His lovely face, <BR>
I rest on His unchanging grace. <BR>
In every high and stormy gale, <BR>
My anchor holds within the veil. <BR>
On Christ the solid Rock I stand, <BR>
All other ground is sinking sand; <BR>
All other ground is sinking sand. <BR><BR>

Verse 3<BR>
His oath, His covenant, His blood, <BR>
Support me in the whelming flood. <BR>
When all around my soul gives way, <BR>
He then is all my hope and stay. <BR>
On Christ the solid Rock I stand, <BR>
All other ground is sinking sand; <BR>
All other ground is sinking sand. <BR>
  Verse 4<BR>
  When He shall come with trumpet sound, <BR>
  Oh may I then in Him be found. <BR>
  Dressed in His righteousness alone, <BR>
  Faultless to stand before the throne. <BR>
  On Christ the solid Rock I stand, <BR>
  All other ground is sinking sand; <BR>
  All other ground is sinking sand. <BR>

                    southern part of Adamawa State. 
                    His ancestry can be traced to a village called Gubara, 
                    but later his father moved to Gwana where he started

                    <a href=""> HIS FATHER, THE MENTOR </a>
                  </h3>
                  <p>  His father was a farmer and a trader, and by local 
                    standard he was a very successful businessman.  As his 
                    business expanded, he moved from Gwana to Guyuk 
                    which was the headquarters of the district, in search 
                    of a bigger market. 
                    The UTC shops in Guyuk where his father traded was 
                    close to the River Gongola, where his father 
                    distributed and retailed essential commodities such as 
                    sugar, soap, tea and clothing items. He had a big shop 
                    in Guyuk Market where people from surrounding 
                    villages came to buy their household items, indeed It 
                    was a local supermarket. 
                    His father's success as a trader and farmer was evident 
                    by the fact that he was among the first few people in 
                    Guyuk to build a house with a Zink roof, and in those 
                    days, that was a very big deal. He also acquired oxen 
                    for plowing, and bought a motor-van for 
                    transportation respectively.
                     During the second republic, his father went into 
                    politics and sponsored individuals into political 
                    offices. As a result, the Government awarded him 
                    with the contract of feeding students at the 
                    Government day secondary school Guyuk. 
                    His father was a philanthropist, and that had a huge 
                    impact on him (Baba Eli). For instance, there was a 
                    period of famine in the entire Numan Federation in 
                    the 1970's due to drought. People were dying of 
                    hunger and some relocated out of the region, 
                    particularly in Guyuk, Baba Gamaliel in his usual 
                    manner as a philanthropist, would travel to Jalingo 
                    town which is present day Taraba State capital and 
                    buy garri, which he sold to families at a very subsidize 
                    rate, in other words he made no profit on it. As a result of that, his house was always crowded with people 
                    trying to purchase the garri. For those who did not 
                    have money he gave them on credit.  </p>

                    <a href=""> HIS EARLY LIFE </a>
                  </h3>
                  <p>  At 3 years old when his father moved from Gwana to 
                    Guyuk, his elder brother was taken to their maternal 
                    uncle “Baba Bilala”, to tend his animals as was the 
                    Lunguda tradition and culture (Matrilineal in 
                    nature). 
                    So, he automatically became the first child in the 
                    house and took up the responsibilities of the first 
                    born of the house. At the age of 5, he started going to 
                    the market with his father. He was trained in informal 
                    book keeping and marketing. His father opened his 
                    shop by 8am or 10 am, after which his father will 
                    leave the responsibility of managing the shop to him 
                    and travel either to Shelleng to buy some goods or go 
                    to the farm. When he returns later in the day, he (Eli) 
                    was relieved to go and play with his friends in the 
                    neighbourhood. Most of the time those games ended 
                    with a fight, but before the end of the day, all quarrels 
                    will be settled by elders and all the children ended up 
                    eating together.
                     This was the circle of his life growing up in the 
                    village. However, his father loved him so much that 
                    he did not allow anybody take him (Baba Eli) away 
                    from him as it was the custom/tradition then. His 
                    mother's brothers tried to take him, but they couldn't 
                    because his father was determined to send him to 
                    school to receive formal education and therefore 
                    refused to let him stay with his uncles.  </p>

                    <a href=""> GOING TO SCHOOL </a>
                  </h3>
                  <p>  He was hurriedly rushed to start school before he was 
                    matured enough just to avoid being taken by his 
                    uncles who wanted him to be a Shepard boy. So 
                    instead of direct entry to primary one, he started from 
                    pre-primary, because at that time your hands had to 
                    go over your head to touch your opposite ear before 
                    you could be admitted into primary 1.
                     His exposure to figures at his father's shop gave him an advantage over his mates, so he was soon 
                     promoted to primary one after only 3 months in the 
                     pre-primary section.
                      He entered junior primary school in 1956 and as soon 
                     as senior primary school was opened in Guyuk, he 
                     was among the 1st set, and graduated in 1964. To be a 
                     graduate of senior primary school in those days was 
                     almost as equal as obtaining a Senior Secondary 
                     School Certificate.
                      Going to Secondary School was very tough, there 
                     were very few colleges and secondary schools, 
                     therefore limited vacancies, and you have to be able to 
                     pass a common entrance examination and interview 
                     to get into any of the colleges. 
                     In 1964 he (Baba Eli) sat for the common entrance 
                     exams. In a class of forty-four (44) pupils, only two of 
                     them were lucky to pass and gained admission into 
                     secondary and teachers college. 
                     Furthermore, he always said that his secondary school 
                     days were the most interesting part of his school life, 
                     because that was the first time he moved out of the 
                     village to the city and also met pupils from other 
                     backgrounds. His school was a new school, called 
                     “Bronnum Secondary School” and he was among the 
                     second set of students to graduate in the school. 
                     When he was in form 4, he was made the Head-boy 
                     of the school, (this position was only given to 
                     students with great academic performance and good 
                     morals). This position was challenging, but 
                     regardless, during his graduation he received the 
                     award for the best in Health Science. 
                     In 1969 when he graduated from the secondary 
                     school, he proceeded to Zaria school of basic studies. After his school of basic studies, which is usually one 
                     year, he proceeded to Jos Plateau State, which was 
                     then Benue-Plateau for nursing school and graduated 
                     after four years of training in the school of nursing, 
                     and was then posted to the General Hospital Yola in  </p>

                  </h3>
                  <p>  As a child, he observed his father organizing meetings 
                    of politicians in their house, of which he was 
                    eventually recruited as their secretary for those 
                    political meetings because he was the only one 
                    around who could read and write. His duties 
                    included writing invitation letters, marking the 
                    register of attendance and recording financial 
                    transactions, all these influenced and shaped his 
                    capacity to coordinate and organise well informed 
                    political activities Locally and Nationally.
                     In his quest for knowledge, he later proceeded to 
                    A.B.U Zaria to study psychology and human 
                    anatomy, while in the university, he joined student 
                    politics; and also had contact with radical lecturers, 
                    like Bala Usman, Patrick Wulimet, Bala Takaya who 
                    organize lectures for radical change. In fact, this had a 
                    great influence on him and his political career. 
                    Before he graduated from the university, he joined 
                    UPN and became the chairman student wing, while 
                    His Excellency Boni Haruna. The former Governor of 
                    Adamawa State between 1999-2007 was his 
                    secretary. 
                    After graduating from A.B.U Zaria he returned to Yola 
                    Adamawa State as a lecturer in the school of nursing. 
                    However, as a lecturer he was deeply involved in 
                    organise Labour struggles, where he met and worked 
                    with Mr. Paschal Bafyua, the Former National Leader 
                    of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC). Because of 
                    his commitment to labour struggle, late Comrade 
                    Pascal Bafyua asked he “Baba Eli” to organise the NLC 
                    structure in Adamawa State being a new state created 
                    from the defunct Gongola State in the year 1991. 
                    While in NLC, they continue to mobilize and push for 
                    change to civil rule, and lecturers in higher 
                    institutions were their contact and resource persons. 
                    However, in 1989, when Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi 
                    Babagida planned a review of the constitution and 
                    members were elected on non-party basis, which 
                    Lead to Hon. Baba Eli to be elected to represent Guyuk/Shelleng Federal Constituency at the 
                    assembly, after which political associations were 
                    formed and he joined the Social Democratic Party 
                    (SDP) and became its P.R.O in Adamawa State under 
                    the chairmanship of Barr. Dr. Boss Gida Mustapha, the 
                    former Secretary to the Government of the 
                    Federation. 
                    He was national coordinator for Prince Baba Adi 
                    presidential campaign and later coordinator for the 
                    Middle belt region to “Chief Arthur Nzerebe” 
                    presidential campaign team.
                     After the June 12 and the military takeover, all 
                    political activities came to a halt in the country, hence 
                    his transition into the hospitality industry, where he 
                    worked in Abuja Sheraton Hotels and Towers, and 
                    resigned as the Director Human Resources in the year 
                    2007 and later returned to active politics in both State 
                    and National level. Above all, late Baba Hon. Eli 
                    Gamaliel was a seasoned and composite grassroots 
                    politician of all time.   </p>

                  <p>   He first met his wife Adah Shadaya in June 1974 in 
                    Maiduguri during documentation for Nursing school 
                    graduates., and immediately knew in his spirit and 
                    body that he had found his soul mate. She was a 
                    young, brown skinned and extremely beautiful lady 
                    who was neatly dressed. She was sitting by herself and 
                    he had to gather all the strength within him to 
                    approach her and started up a friendly conversation.
                     Their discussion was not encouraging as he (Eli) was a 
                    bit shy and she was a bit passive. But as soon as the 
                    posting came out, they were both posted to Yola 
                    General Hospital. Thereafter, their relationship 
                    deepened in Yola, and she began to warm up to him. 
                    Everyone around them, especially at the work place 
                    knew that they were in a relationship. 
                    After a period of dating and getting to know each 
                    other, he proposed to her and she accepted. He then 
                    quickly informed his father, who reached out to her 
                    parents, and asked for the bride price, which was paid .
                    in the sum of N60. They later got married.
                    In 1975 their 1st son Suri was conceived and born 
                   through a caesarean section, it was a delicate and 
                   complicated procedure. The doctor in the process 
                   committed some errors that led to two subsequent 
                   operations, after which it was medically concluded 
                   that his wife cannot be pregnant again, but 
                   miraculously God visited them and his wife 
                   conceived, but afterward they lost the baby on health 
                   grounds and so they gave up hope of having other 
                   children.
                    God in His mercies still showed up for them, and 
                   blessed them with more children. They are proud 
                   parents to 3 young men.</p>

                <p><strong> Senator Dr. J. S. Zwingina</strong>  <BR>  My dear Comrade, your departure is hard to believe but the Lord knows all. You left a loving and worthy family for which we are proud. We pray to meet you again to part no more.</p>
                <p> <strong>  Boss Mustapha </strong> <BR>  , a dear brother, friend, and political associate of all times, has gone home to rest in the bosom of the Lord. Rest in peace, Adieu my confidant. Boss Mustapha</p>
                <p >  <STRONG> Dr. Pogu Bitrus (President Middle Belt Forum)  </STRONG>   <BR> dear friend, , you lived a fulfilled life as a middle belter of repute and your passing is a great loss to all of us. The indelible mark you have printed in the hearts of many in the Middle Belt Region, will remain with us and our memories of your commitment and good works will ever be remembered. Rest in the bosom of the Lord dear compatriot. </p>
                <p> <strong>Sylvester N. Baruwa </strong> <BR>  A great gem has been lost. May his soul Rest in Peace. </p>
                <p ><STRONG>Comr. Emmanuel Ishaku Balami  </STRONG>  <BR>   OMG. My colleague and friend  have gone too soon but God knows why. It is an appointed time. The children and your wife with friends had fought the battle but the decision is final. We will miss you, especially when last I came and we talked at length and encouraged each other and you ate your food and your wife was very happy. Rest in Perfect Peace. </p>
                <p  > <STRONG> . Pastor Isaac Ahangba Agwaza </STRONG>  <BR>  RIP Daddy. Thanks for a life well lived and the children you have raised. You will forever be remembered</p>

                  <p><strong>It is with profound sadness that we in Lunguda Development Association (LDA) received the news of the death of Comrade Eli Gamaliel.</strong></p>
                  <p>We remember with nostalgia how, as a Nurse, he gave hope, succor, encouragement, support and, invaluable nursing care to all and sundry. We also remember in those hey days of Marxism how Comrade Eli Gamaliel, alongside Comrade (now Senator) Jonathan S. Zwingina and others, would courageously take on any government or authority on behalf of anyone whose rights were being denied or trampled upon. Their struggles against a well-entrenched feudalistic system not only raised our collective consciousness to the sanctity of citizens' rights and privileges but also added value to our shared journey through this life. Without Comrade Eli Gamaliel and his Marxist co-travelers' effort by now these feudal forces would have driven us aground.</p>
                  <p>As we mourn Comrade Eli Gamaliel's loss, let us celebrate his life, his legacy, and the enduring impact he has had on each of us. Let his family, friends, and loved ones find solace in these cherished memories and the knowledge that Comrade Eli touched many lives in so many in profound ways. Adieu Comrade!</p>
